#### D-Link Wireless Extender Scripts

This repository contain various unofficial and probably-not-supported-by-D-Link Python 3 scripts to play with D-Link WiFi extenders by replicating packets the web interface uses. It was only tested on a DAP-1520 with firmware version 1.06, but probably works on some other DAP extenders and firmware versions.

All the files are under the zlib license.

## Files
- reboot.py - reboots a selected extender
- changepassword.py - changes the admin password of an extender

Ideally in the future everything will be better organised and less hack-y.
